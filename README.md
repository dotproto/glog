GistLog is a simple blog backed by GitHub Gists.

Sure, there are other Gist-based blogs out there, but for some reason they're hosted on Heroku or require rails or some other crazyness. Making and editing Gists is easy. Blogging should be too.

GitHub offers free web hosting for static content and frontend web tech is pretty powerful. You don't need a dedicated blogging service and shouldn't be put through the hastle of setting one up.
