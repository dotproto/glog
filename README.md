**Glog** is a simple blog powered by GitHub [Pages](pages.github.com) and [Gists](gist.github.com).

# Overview

GitHub offers free web hosting for static content and frontend web tech is pretty powerful. You don't need a dedicated blogging service and shouldn't be put through the hastle of setting one up.


# Motivation

[I](http://github.com/svincent) started working on Glog because I couldn't find a blogging system I was happy with. I've been looking for a way to blog that ...

* is free (both [gratis and libre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre)
* gives me control of my words/data
* uses a simple syntax like Markdown
* lets me post using a simple web interface
* doesn't require a build step
* can be hosted on a personal domain
* has minimal (to no) monitary overhead
* doesn't require maintenance

While there are plenty of other blogging solutions out there I haven't seen any that meet all of these requirements.

# Design

... Page data provided by [GitHub Gists](http://developer.github.com/v3/gists/)

Sure, there are other Gist-based blogs out there 

they're hosted on Heroku or require rails or some other crazyness. Making and editing Gists is easy. Blogging should be too.
